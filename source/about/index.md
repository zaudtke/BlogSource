#### A little bit about me

I am an Architect at J. J. Keller &amp; Associates, Inc. with over 18 years of experience working with subscription based web applications.  Primarily I work on web applcications using the .Net stack, and recently we are working on Cloud Native solutions in Azure.  These solutions are not only web applications, but there is also an IoT solution currently being built.

Since spring of 2015, I have been a remote employee.  My company is in Wisconsin, and I worked out of the office until my wife and I decided to make a change.  I now live in Knoxville, TN and absolutely love being a remote employee.  There were some challenges early on, but we worked through them all, and now we have a number of distance employees on our team.

In addition to designing and building solutions, I am trying to do more presentations.  I have presented a few times, but am always looking to challenge myself to give more.

My hope is that the more I learn, I will try to blog more, and hopefully up more opportunites, as well as share it with you.

Happy Coding
