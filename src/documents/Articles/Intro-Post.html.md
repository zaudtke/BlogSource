# Introduction Blog Post

### AKA Hello World

Well I decided to take the plunge and build a blog.  Seeing as how I am a geek,
I wanted to learn something new while doing it.  However, learning could not outweigh
actually getting something done.  I've been down that road before and I always
take on something too big to learn something new.  This seems to be a good balance
between them.

Yes I am putting the final minimum viable requirement
touches on this at [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/).  What better
place to push me over the edge to do so.  That and the Open Spaces session on
Starting a blog that occurs tomorrow (8/12/2014).

There will be an upcoming post detailing how I built this, but the short list is:
* [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
* [DocPad](http://docpad.org/)  and by default [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
