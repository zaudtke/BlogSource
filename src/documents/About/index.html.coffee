h2 "My name is Al, but you probably already knew that"

p "I am an Architect at J. J. Keller and Associates, Inc. with over 13 years of experience working with subscription based web applications."

p "My primary focus has been Web based solutions, but I am working in the mobile world as well, and would like to expand my expertise there.  I have worked with both Android and iOS commercially, and Windows 8/Phone 8 on the side a bit."

p "At work our mobile platform has taken off, and now I am getting into performance, scaling, and distributed systems.  The distributed systems is what is really interesting to me at this time.  Utilizing the Cloud and sub systems to bring it all together sounds like a lot of fun."

p "Since I've been primarliy a MS guy, I wanted to push myself outside that box, so this blog is being written sans MS.  Let's see how it goes."
